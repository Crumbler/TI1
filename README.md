All ciphers except for Playfair are written to be symbol-independent.
You can use any symbols. They don't have to be letters.

The rotating grid cipher may add extra spaces to the message. For that reason it prints an '|' after the message so you can see where it ends.

The Playfair cipher only accepts lowercase English letters.
